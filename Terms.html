            <pre>
            
                    ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
                Oath Holdings Inc. ("Mobile") welcomes you. Mobile provides the Mobile Services (defined below) to you subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: https://policies.Mobile.com/us/en/Mobile/terms/utos/index.html. By accessing and using the Mobile Services, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of the TOS. In addition, when using particular Mobile owned or operated services, you and Mobile shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time. All such guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Spam Policy) are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. Mobile may also offer other services that are governed by different Terms of Service. In such cases the other terms of service will be posted on the relevant service to which they apply.
                DESCRIPTION OF Mobile SERVICES
                Mobile provides users with access to a rich collection of resources, including without limitation various communications tools, forums, shopping services, search services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties which may be accessed through any various medium or device now known or hereafter developed (the "Mobile Services"). You also understand and agree that the Mobile Services may include advertisements and that these advertisements are necessary for Mobile to provide the Mobile Services. You also understand and agree that the Mobile Services may include certain communications from Mobile, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Mobile Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Mobile membership and you will not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Mobile Services, including the release of new Mobile properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Mobile Services is provided "AS-IS" and that Mobile assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Mobile Services, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Mobile Services. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Mobile Services, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. Please be aware that Mobile has created certain areas on the Mobile Services that contain adult or mature content. You must be at least 18 years of age to access and view such areas.
                YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS
                In consideration of your use of the Mobile Services, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving the Mobile Services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. You also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Mobile Service's registration form (the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Mobile has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Mobile has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Mobile Services (or any portion thereof). You must be aged 13 or over to use the Services. If you have a pre-existing Family Account covering children aged under 13 then you have an ongoing responsibility to determine whether any of the Mobile Services areas and/or Content (as defined in Section 6 below) are appropriate for your child.
                Mobile PRIVACY POLICY
                Registration Data and certain other information about you are subject to our applicable privacy policy. For more information, see the full Mobile Privacy Policy at https://policies.Mobile.com/us/en/Mobile/privacy/index.html. You understand that through your use of the Mobile Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the applicable privacy policy) of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States and/or other countries for storage, processing and use by Mobile and its affiliates.
                MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY
                You will receive a password and account designation upon completing the Mobile Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify Mobile of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. Mobile cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 5.
                MEMBER CONDUCT
                You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags, or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that you, and not Mobile, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available via the Mobile Services. Mobile does not control the Content posted via the Mobile Services and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. You understand that by using the Mobile Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will Mobile be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Mobile Services. You agree to not use the Mobile Services to:
                upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable;
                harm minors in any way;

                upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any Content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as inside information, proprietary and confidential information learned or disclosed as part of employment relationships or under nondisclosure agreements);
                upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any Content that infringes any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights ("Rights") of any party;
                upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, "junk mail," "spam," "chain letters," "pyramid schemes," or any other form of solicitation, except in those areas (such as shopping) that are designated for such purpose (please read our complete Spam Policy);
                upload, post, email, transmit, or otherwise make available any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;
                disrupt the normal flow of dialogue, cause a screen to "scroll" faster than other users of the Mobile Services are able to type, or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other users' ability to engage in real time exchanges;
                interfere with or disrupt the Mobile Services or servers or networks connected to the Mobile Services, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to the Mobile Services, including using any device, software or routine to bypass our robot exclusion headers;
                intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, including, but not limited to, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, including, without limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ, and any regulations having the force of law;
                provide material support or resources (or to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, or ownership of material support or resources) to any organization(s) designated by the United States government as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;
                "stalk" or otherwise harass another; and/or
                collect or store personal data about other users in connection with the prohibited conduct and activities set forth in paragraphs 6.1 through 6.13 above.
                You acknowledge that Mobile may or may not pre-screen Content, but that Mobile and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove any Content that is available via the Mobile Services. Without limiting the foregoing, Mobile and its designees shall have the right to remove any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable. You agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by Mobile or submitted to Mobile, including without limitation information in Mobile Message Boards and in all other parts of the Mobile Services.
                You acknowledge, consent and agree that Mobile may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the TOS; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Mobile, its users and the public.

                You understand that the Mobile Services and software embodied within the Mobile Services may include security components that permit digital materials to be protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set by Mobile and/or content providers who provide content to the Mobile Services. You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage rules embedded into the Mobile Services. Any unauthorized reproduction, publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials provided on the Mobile Services, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.

                INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON Mobile NETWORK
                When you register with Mobile, you acknowledge that in using the Mobile Services to send electronic communications (including but not limited to email, search queries, sending messages to Mobile Chat or Mobile Groups, uploading photos and files to Flickr, and other Internet activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through Mobile's computer networks, portions of which are located in California, Texas, Virginia, and other locations in the United States and portions of which are located abroad. As a result, and also as a result of Mobile's network architecture and business practices and the nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate communications regardless of where you are physically located at the time of transmission. Accordingly, by agreeing to this TOS, you acknowledge that use of the service results in interstate data transmissions.
                SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE AND EXPORT AND IMPORT COMPLIANCE
                Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Use of the Mobile Services and transfer, posting and uploading of software, technology, and other technical data via the Mobile Services may be subject to the export and import laws of the United States and other countries. You agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations, including without limitation the Export Administration Regulations (see http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html) and sanctions control programs of the United States (see http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx). In particular, you represent and warrant that you: (a) are not a prohibited party identified on any government export exclusion lists (see http://www.bis.doc.gov/complianceandenforcement/liststocheck.htm) or a member of a government of any other export-prohibited countries as identified in applicable export and import laws and regulations; (b) will not transfer software, technology, and other technical data via the Mobile Services to export-prohibited parties or countries; (c) will not use the Mobile Services for military, nuclear, missile, chemical or biological weaponry end uses in violation of U.S. export laws; and (d) will not transfer, upload, or post via the Mobile Services any software, technology or other technical data in violation of U.S. or other applicable export or import laws.
                CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE Mobile SERVICES
                Mobile does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Mobile Services. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Mobile Services, you grant Mobile the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable:
                With respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of Mobile Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Mobile Services solely for the purposes of providing and promoting the specific Mobile Group to which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Mobile Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Mobile removes such Content from the Mobile Services.
                With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Mobile Services other than Mobile Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Mobile Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Mobile Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Mobile removes such Content from the Mobile Services.
                With respect to Content other than photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Mobile Services other than Mobile Groups, the perpetual, irrevocable and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and publicly display such Content (in whole or in part) and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed.
                "Publicly accessible" areas of the Mobile Services are those areas of the Mobile network of properties that are intended by Mobile to be available to the general public. By way of example, publicly accessible areas of the Mobile Services would include Mobile Message Boards and portions of Mobile Groups and Flickr that are open to both members and visitors. However, publicly accessible areas of the Mobile Services would not include portions of Mobile Groups that are limited to members, Mobile services intended for private communication such as Mobile Mail or Mobile Messenger, or areas off of the Mobile network of properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by Mobile.

                CONTRIBUTIONS TO Mobile 
                By submitting ideas, suggestions, documents, and/or proposals ("Contributions") to Mobile through its suggestion or feedback webpages, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) your Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information; (b) Mobile is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; (c) Mobile shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in any media worldwide; (d) Mobile may have something similar to the Contributions already under consideration or in development; (e) your Contributions automatically become the property of Mobile without any obligation of Mobile to you; and (f) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Mobile under any circumstances.

                You agree to indemnify and hold Mobile and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit, modify or otherwise make available through the Mobile Services, your use of the Mobile Services, your connection to the Mobile Services, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.
                NO COMMERCIAL REUSE OF Mobile SERVICES 
                You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion or use of, or access to, the Mobile Services (including Content, advertisements, Software and your Mobile ID).
                GENERAL PRACTICES REGARDING USE AND STORAGE

Whether or not you use this feature, other users may choose to use it to save conversations with you in their account on Mobile too. Your agreement to this TOS constitutes your consent to allow Mobile to store these communications on its servers.

                You acknowledge and agree that the Mobile Services and any necessary software used in connection with the Mobile Services ("Software") contain proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. You further acknowledge and agree that Content contained in advertisements or information presented to you through the Mobile Services or by advertisers is protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents or other proprietary rights and laws.

                GENERAL INFORMATION
                Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Mobile and governs your use of the Mobile Services, superseding any prior version of this TOS between you and Mobile with respect to the Mobile Services. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Mobile services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. Choice of Law and Forum. You and Mobile each agree that the TOS and the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any and all claims, causes of action or disputes (regardless of theory) arising out of or relating to the TOS, or the relationship between you and Mobile, shall be brought exclusively in the courts located in the county of Santa Clara, California or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. You and Mobile agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California or the Northern District of California, and agree to waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts and to venue in such courts. Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Mobile to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect. No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your Mobile account is non-transferable and any rights to your Mobile ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted. Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Mobile Services or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Mobile may freely assign the TOS and all of the policies and other documents incorporated or referenced in it (including all rights, licenses, and obligations under it or them), in whole or in part and without notice.
